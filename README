# walltalk

Use this to retroactively capture audio.  This is handy for capturing serindipitous 
moments with family - especially youngsters.  If you keep at it, you end up with a 
self-edited set of audio higlights spanning years.

Building

This app requires:

    * JACK
    * GTK+ 2.x
    * libsndfile
    * wiringPi

You will also need the -devel packages if you're using packages.

./configure
make
su -c "make install"

Usage

The install will place files in necessary locations for necessary daemons to 
run automatically after boot-up.  The capture can be initiated by either the 
pushbutton physically attached to the device, or through a wireless doorbell
pushbutton. 

It will create a file following tm-*.wav, with an ISO 8601 timestamp, eg
tm-2003-01-19T20:47:03.wav. The time is the time that the recording starts
from, not when you click.
